This is a landing page project for my wedding at the end of 2019.

Contents:
1. Header Banner - (Our coat-of-arms logo, date, hashtag and RSVP CTA)
2. RSVP form (Name, group [Moronz, CCDJ, etc], number of pax, comments/requests)
2a. After RSVP deadline has crossed, change to Well-Wishes Form (Name, comment box)
3. Upload photos of the event day -> Google Drive link
4. Videos (Pre: How We Met, childhood photo slide? Post: Nikah video teaser, Full teaser )
5. Quiz on how well do you know the couple? Haha!
